		<p> Hello! My name is Davide Bianchi and I am currently a senior in Boston
		University's College of Fine Arts pursuing a BFA with a major in Graphic Design.
		I’ve been making art for as long as I can remember and I developed an interest in
		design specifically toward the end of high school. I was lucky enough to attend
		schools that had art programs which allowed me to explore various fields of art.
		My interest in form and color, which I initially explored and expressed through
		abstract art, slowly led me to design where I found an incredible passion for
		typography and visually engaging compositions. My style generally ranges from clean
		and modern with an emphasis on conveying information/meaning as clearly as possible
		to more visually dynamic work that uses bright, contrasting, psychedelic forms and
		colors. </p>

		<p> What I love most about design is its unique ability to communicate something’s
		purpose or someone’s idea. To achieve this goal of communication I find the ability
		to adapt and modify my style is not just beneficial but necessary. In fact, it is
		an enjoyable challenge to figure out what the right typeface, color palate, form,
		and composition makes sense for whatever I’m working on. Beyond my love for design
		I’m also very passionate about photography, hip-hop music, and staying active
		through weight-lifting, walking, and sports like soccer, basketball, and cycling.
	 	I believe all these interests stimulate ideas and contribute to my design, even
		if some may correlate more than others. </p>
